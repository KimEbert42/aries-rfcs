# ![Aries RFCs](collateral/aries-rfcs-logo.png)

This repo holds Request for Comment (RFCs) for the Aries project. They describe important
topics ([not minor details](contributing.md#do-you-need-an-RFC)) that we want to
standardize across the Aries ecosystem.

If you are here to learn about Aries, we recommend you use the [the RFC Index](index.md) for a current listing of all RFCs and their statuses.

There are 2 types of Aries RFCs:

* RFCs that describe individual features (in the `./features` folder)
* RFCs that explain concepts underpinning many features (in the `./concepts` folder)

RFCs are for developers *building on* Aries. They don't provide guidance on how Aries components
implement features internally; individual Aries repos have design docs for that. Each
Aries RFC includes an "implementations" section and all RFCs with a status greater than
`Proposed` should have at least one listed implementation.

## RFC Lifecycle

RFCs go through a standard lifecycle.

<!-- To edit this lifecycle drawing:
 - Copy the URL below
 - Navigate to https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml/
 - Paste the URL into the text area in the middle of the screen beside the "Decode URL" button.
 - Click the "Decode URL" button and the editable Plantuml definition of the drawing will be in the top of the box.
 - Edit the lifecycle drawing as desired.
 - When complete, copy the resulting URL from the box. Note that the copied URL is missing the leading "https:".
 - Replace the URL below, ensuring to add the `https:` at the beginning.
 - Done!

#### PROPOSED
To __propose__ an RFC, [use these instructions to raise a PR](
contributing.md#how-to-propose-an-RFC) against the repo. Proposed
RFCs are considered a "work in progress", even after they are merged. In other words, they
haven't been endorsed by the community yet, but they seem like reasonable ideas worth
exploring.

#### DEMONSTRATED
__Demonstrated__ RFCs have one or more implementations available, listed in the "Implementations" section of the RFC document. As with the PROPOSED status, demonstrated RFCs haven't been endorsed by the community, but the ideas put forth have been more thoroughly explored through the implementation(s). The demonstrated status is an optional step in the lifecycle. For protocol-related RFCs, work on protocol tests SHOULD begin in the [test suite repo](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-protocol-test-suite) by the time this status is assigned.

#### ACCEPTED
To get an RFC __accepted__, [build consensus](contributing.md#how-to-get-an-RFC-accepted) for your RFC on [chat](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/aries) and in community meetings. If your RFC is a feature that's protocol- or decorator-related, it MUST have reasonable tests in the [test suite repo](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-agent-test-harness), it MUST list the test suite in the protocol RFC's [Implementations section](/0000-template.md#implementations), at least one other implementation must have passed the relevant portions of the test suite, and all implementations listed in this section of the RFC MUST hyperlink to their test results. An accepted RFC is incubating on a standards track; the community has decided to polish it and is exploring or pursuing implementation.

#### ADOPTED
To get an RFC __adopted__, [socialize and implement](contributing.md#how-to-get-an-rfc-adopted). An RFC gets this status once it has significant momentum--when implementations accumulate, or when the mental model it advocates has begun to permeate our discourse. In other words, adoption is acknowledgment of a _de facto_ standard.

To __refine__ an RFC, propose changes to it through additional PRs. Typically these changes are driven by experience that accumulates during or after adoption. Minor refinements that just improve clarity can happen inline with lightweight review. Status is still ADOPTED.

#### STALLED
An RFC is __stalled__ when a [proposed](#proposed) RFC makes
no progress towards implementation such that it is extremely unlikely it will ever move forward. The __stalled__ state differs from [retired](#retired) in that it is an RFC that has never been implemented or superseded. Like the [retired](#retired) state, it is (likely) an end state and the RFC will not proceed further. Such an RFC remains in the repository on the off chance it will ring a chord with others, be returned to the [proposed](#proposed) state, and continue to evolve.

#### RETIRED
An RFC is __retired__ when it is withdrawn from community consideration by its authors, when implementation seems permanently stalled, or when significant refinements require a superseding document. If a retired RFC has been superseded, its `Superseded By` field should contain a link to the newer spec, and the newer spec's `Supersedes` field should contain a link to the older spec. Permalinks are not broken.

#### Acknowledgement

The structure and a lot of the initial language of this repository was borrowed from [Indy HIPEs](
https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe), which borrowed it from [Rust RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs).
Their good work has made the setup of this repository much quicker and better than it otherwise would have been.
